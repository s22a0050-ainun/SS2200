st.success("""
Although the Pie Chart reveals that **75% of students who have overall mental health problems are female**, 
the Stacked Bar Chart offers a more complicated structure of particular aspects. The second chart shows that 
**4 females and 2 males experienced Depression**, **4 females and 1 male experienced Anxiety**, and 
**2 females and 3 males experienced a Panic Attack**. This shows females gave more answers to the questions 
about **Depression** and **Anxiety**, while males gave slightly more responses to the question about **Panic Attack**.  
This trend is indeed verified by the third chart, which specifically dealt with Depression, and the results 
showed that of the students who responded ‚ÄúYes‚Äù to having Depression, there were **3 female students and 1 male student**.  
On the whole, there is a much higher percentage of **mental health cases in females**, mainly due to increased cases of 
**Depression and Anxiety**.
