st.success("""
The visualizations focus on the experience of the students with **Panic Attacks**, which shows that **33%** 
of all the surveyed students have had one, as shown in the general pie chart. The Bar Chart that presents the 
number by gender shows that there is a **drastic difference** in the number of cases reported with **25 female 
students** reporting to have a Panic Attack and **8 male students**. This demonstrates that **female students are 
more likely to report a Panic Attack** compared to male students.  

Moreover, the **Stacked Bar Chart** subdivides the cases of Panic Attacks into various courses, and the majority 
of these reported cases are in the **Engineering** and **BIT** courses, which have the highest number of respondents.  
It is important to note that other courses such as **Diploma Nursing, Human Resources, Law, Pendidikan Islam, and Psychology** 
had students only stating ‚ÄúNo‚Äù to a Panic Attack, while the **IT** course had a few students responding ‚ÄúYes‚Äù.
